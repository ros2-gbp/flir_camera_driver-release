* Add auto exposure ROI parameters (`#52 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/52>`_)
  * spinnaker_camera_driver: setProperty: report available enum values
  Only done on failure. This helps to figure out which enum values are

  This is highly useful when using fisheye lenses, which illuminate only
  a circle in the center of the image. The AE gets confused by the black
  regions around it and overexposes the image.
  This also exposes the "AutoExposureLightingMode" parameter, which allows
  the user to choose a lighting preset (front/back/normal).
